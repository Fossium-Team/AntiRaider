# AntiRaider
A simple anti-raid Discord bot

## Installing
First, create a bot application [here](https://discord.com/developers) (if you don't know how, search it with your preferred search engine)\
**Make sure all intents are enabled**\
After that, download the latest release [here](https://github/Fossium-Team/AntiRaider/releases/latest) and unzip it in a preferred folder
#### Install Ruby:
  Windows: Download the latest **Ruby+Devkit** [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)\
  Linux: Install `ruby` (on Debian/Ubuntu `ruby-full`) with your favorite package manager\
  MacOS: **Don't use the included Ruby with MacOS**, install it with homebrew instead `brew install ruby`
#### After that install all the gems:
  `bundle install` (in the AntiRaider directory)
 
This may take some time because some gems need to build system native extensions\
After that you can run the Ruby file (just opening it should work, if it doesn't or if you use a terminal-based OS use Powershell/CMD or the terminal: `ruby ./antiraider.rb`)
